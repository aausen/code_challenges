"""Write a function that encrypts a string with a variable rotary cipher.

The function should take in a number and string and shift the string's
characters by that number:

>>> rot_encode(1, 'abcxyz')
'bcdyza'

It should be able to shift characters by any number:

>>> rot_encode(3, 'abcxyz')
'defabc'

It should preserve capitalization, whitespace, and any special characters:

>>> rot_encode(1, 'Wow! This is 100% amazing.')
'Xpx! Uijt jt 100% bnbajoh.'
